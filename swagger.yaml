    # Assignment

    Please build an API using Laravel 9.x (latest) to demonstrate your expertise. This API should have the following capabilities:

    1. Full CRUD on a users model
    2. Full CRUD on a document management model
    3. Full CRUD linking documents to users

    Keep in mind that user-friendly APIs consider the end user. To that end, ensure that you include the following:

    1. OpenAPI specification documentation on each endpoint, including full request/response samples
    2. Proper error handling and messaging for invalid requests as well as any potential server-side failures.
    3. Any additional considerations that demonstrate your knowledge of best practices for Restful APIs
