# Assignment

Please build an API using Laravel 9.x (latest) to demonstrate your expertise. This API should have the following capabilities:

1. Full CRUD on a users model
2. Full CRUD on a document management model
3. Full CRUD linking documents to users

Keep in mind that user-friendly APIs consider the end user. To that end, ensure that you include the following:

1. OpenAPI specification documentation on each endpoint, including full request/response samples
2. Proper error handling and messaging for invalid requests as well as any potential server-side failures.
3. Any additional considerations that demonstrate your knowledge of best practices for Restful APIs
